# Notes from the meeting

**crop model** or soil model
- explore spatial distribution (of yields)

What to simulate:
 - **crop yields** across Europe (of winter wheat)
 - harvesting time - when does it stop growing

crop model input parameters
- temperature and radiation

As output:
- maps showing the results

R package to load the NASA power dataset
- monthly temperatures

Download a soil moisture model - feed it into our model

Exclude points above certain above see level
use the crop calendar to select the starting date of the simulation (the date of sowing)
Only include croplands (corine data set)
- aggregate to get the desired resolution
