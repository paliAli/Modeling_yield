# Modeling_yield
Biogeochemical modelling course group project

# Goal of the project
Simulate crop yield of winter wheat 
*Possible options*
- simulate the crop yield for one year over Europe
- create a time series
- simulate crop yield in the future under different climate scenarios

  # Winter wheat distribution

  # Climate parameters

  # Yield prediction model
